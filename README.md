## INTRODUCTION

## METHOD DETAILS

### Single-cell transcriptome analysis 
Data normalization, unsupervised cell clustering, and differential expression were carried out using the Seurat R package. Batch effect and cell-cycle effect were removed by Combat and Seurat together.

The Cells with less than 500 genes or 2000 UMIs or more than 15% of mitochondria genes were excluded from the analysis. Gene expression raw counts were normalized following a global-scaling normalization method with a scale factor of 10,000 and a log 2 transformation, using the Seurat NormalizeData function. The top 4000 highly variable genes were selected using the expression and dispersion (variance/mean) of genes. Combat removed the batch effect. Seurat regressed the difference between the G2M and S phase, then followed by principal component analysis (PCA). The most significant principal components (1-30) were used for unsupervised clustering and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE). 

Cell types were manually identified by marker genes, and confirmed by SingleR (Single-cell Recognition) package. Differential expression analysis was performed based on the MAST (Model-based Analysis of Single Cell Transcriptomics). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed based on GSEA software and Molecular Signature Database(MSigDB). Pathways were visualized by EnrichmentMap in Cytoscape.

Cell types were identified by SingleR (Single-cell Recognition) package. SingleR is a novel computational method for unbiased cell type recognition of scRNA-seq. SingleR leverages reference transcriptomic datasets of pure cell types to infer the cell of origin of each of the single cells independently.

We processed and annotated three reference mouse datasets:

Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen): a collection of 830 microarray samples, which we classified to 20 main cell types and further annotated to 253 subtypes.

A dataset of 358 mouse RNA-seq samples annotated to 28 cell types. This dataset was collected, processed and shared, courtesy of Bérénice Benayoun. This data set is especially useful for brain-related samples.

GSE43717: Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis (RNA-Seq cells). This dataset contains five mouse testis cell types including Sertoli cells, Spermatogonia, Spermatocytes, Spermatids, and Spermatozoa.

Modified FindAllMarkers() `FindAllMarkers.UMI()` will generate similar dataframe plus two extra columns `UMI.1` and `UMI.2` to record nUMI. `UMI.1` is average nUMI of current cluster, `UMI.2` is average nUMI of all rest of clusters.<br />
`FindAllMarkers(object, test.use = "MAST")` : MAST (Model-based Analysis of Single Cell Transcriptomics), a GLM-framework that treates cellular detection rate as a covariate (Finak et al, Genome Biology, 2015)<br />

Below is an example of a Differential analysis output file.
